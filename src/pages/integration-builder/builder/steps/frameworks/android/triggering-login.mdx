title: Triggering the login
---

Trigger login flow with the selected provider from the list of providers available under `com.web3auth.core.Web3Auth.Provider` such as GOOGLE,
FACEBOOK, TWITTER, EMAIL_PASSWORDLESS, etc. `web3Auth.login()` requires `LoginParams` as a required input.

If you are using the `email_passwordless` login provider, you will also have to specify the email address as `login_hint` in the `extraLoginOptions`
as well.
