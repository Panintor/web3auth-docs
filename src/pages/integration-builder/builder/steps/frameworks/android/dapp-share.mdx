title: dApp Share
---

Web3Auth issues a dApp Share, ie. a backup share that can be stored by the app developer directly within their application and used to reconstruct the
private key after successful login by the user.

After a successful login from a user, the user details are returned as a response to the application in mobile devices.

Web3Auth reponse has a field called `dappShare` which is a 24 words seed phrase that can be used to reconstruct the private key. This dappShare is a
suplement to the Share A and represents half of the private key. The application can store the dApp share in their own application local storage
safely.

Now, while logging in, the user can use their social accounts to obtain one share, and the application provides the dApp Share, removing the need to
store the share in the browser context and enabling user to login seamlessly. This can be done by passing over the stored dApp share value in the
login function.
